# Detect Pattern In Image

The "corr2" function in matlab (R = corr2(A,B)) proves to be very useful for pattern recognition in image processing. <br>
This function can be used to analyze two 2-dimensional images of the same size based on their similarity. <br>
First, both images need to be converted to ùëõ ùë• ùëö -sized arrays. 
It should be noted that the arrays must be of the same dimension in order to be processed further. <br>
With the parameters (A) and (B) passed to the "corr2(..,..)" function, the correlation coefficient R is returned as result. 
The correlation coefficient R represents the similarity between (A) and (B) by setting the relation of the respective pixel intensity in relation to the average pixel intensity of the whole image. 
<br>
Hence, the corr2 function represents the following equation to determine the correlation coefficient R:

<br>
According to the equation R lies between 0 and 1; Where R = 0 means that there is no correlation and R = 1 indicates the maximum strengthof the relationship.<br></br>

## Concept:
First, the script converts the imported image (A) and pattern (B) from RGB to GRAY-scale images. 
Second, it is checked whether image (A) is larger or at least quals the size of pattern (B).
If the size check of (A) and (B) results in a
At the end, a red rectangle is placed at the  and the correlation coefficient (R) is displayed in the command window.

## Result:

In Matlab the Corr2 function computes the 2D correlation coefficient (R) between two Images.
CheckForPatternInImage.m is a simple Matlab script that detects a pattern (A) in an image (B) using the corr2 function.
