In Matlab the Corr2 function computes the 2D correlation coefficient (R) between two Image A and B.
CheckForPatternInImage is a simple Matlab script to detect a pattern (A) in an image (B) using the corr2 function.
The correlation coefficient (R) is displayed in the command window.
Required: Image Processing Toolbox
